# Road-Accident-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Road Accident datasets using sql and tableau. Attached is also the dataset in Excel

# ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS

This is one project I jumped on to analyse and find out more about why there are so many road deaths worldwide. It baffled me not understanding why people will deliberately throw themselves on moving vehicles. However, after analyzing this dataset, I realised there was more to what I always thought. opening my eyes to certain factors.
So to begin, I downloaded this dataset from kaggle after which we uploaded it into tableau and started analyzing the dataset. I created a dashboard for each of the factors that causes road accidents. from horses all the way to cars so let's get in.

# DATA CLEANING

Frankly, there weren't alot of data cleaning to do here. I just changed some datatypes and went on with my analysis. But before then, I levereged on tableau's calculated column to perform some calculations and analysis which isn't much but can be seen in the actual work. it was perhaps the tableau visualization that we heavily relied on for insights and so much time was spent visualizing the dataset.

# DATA VISUALIZATION

This project had 9 dashboards in total;

So this was the stages I took in performing this dashboard.)
